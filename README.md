# interdependent-networks-attacks

This project will contain the code used to perform the attack simulations over physical-logical interdependent networks as specified in [the model presented here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1874548221000688) [1]. More specifically, these simulations aim to simulate cascading failures over this interdependent network model to obtain the G<sub>L</sub> after the networks have stabilized.

This is an ongoing project and this readme will contain more information as new functionalities are added.
